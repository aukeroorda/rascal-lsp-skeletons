## Contents
This repository contains a [tutorial](./tutorial.md) for setting up a Rascal project to be used in VS-code.
Each of the 4 main steps is accompanied by a branch:
1. `maven-project`
2. `rascal-project`
3. `java-bindings`
4. `local-java-libs`

These branches are examples of the project state after each step. Note that there are 4 pull-requests between each step and the previous. In these pull-requests you can see an overview of the changes made to complete the step.
