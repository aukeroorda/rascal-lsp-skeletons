## Contents
This repository contains a [tutorial](./tutorial.md) for setting up a Rascal project to be used in VS-code.
Each of the 4 main steps is accompanied by a branch:
1. Setting up the maven project. Files can be found in branch `maven-project`
2. How to make this a Rascal project: `rascal-project`
3. Including Java code in your Rascal project: `java-bindings`
4. Using jars that are not available on Maven: `local-java-libs`

These branches are examples of the project state after each step. Note that there are 4 pull-requests between each step and the previous. In these pull-requests you can see an overview of the changes made to complete the step.
